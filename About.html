                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <h3></em>2019-2020 Networking Year 1</em></h3>
                    <p>After spending 2 years working retail at Canadian Tire I grew tired of my job and wanted a chance at a real career.
                        I enrolled in the Networking program at St Clair and had a very successful year 1 until the world succumb to Covid-19. 
                        The online learning wasn't for me and I lost any passion I had for my course so I decided to drop out and reorient myself.
                    </p>
                    <h3></em>2023-2024 Computer Programming Year 1</em></h3>
                    <p>Having dropped out of networking I was lost on where I wanted to go afterwards and I didn't know if I wanted to stick
                        with computers or technology afterwards. Utlimately I came back to decide on programming because it was something familiar
                        and I could see myself working on. This time I intend on finishing the program and continuing to learn after school.

                    <h2>Employment</h2>
                    <h3></em>Canadian Tire</em></h3>
                    <p>My first job was at Canadian Tire as a cashier and customer service. I learned how to be much more social than I regularly was
                        and it helped me significantly interacting with strangers. 
                    </p>
                    <h3></em>Home Depot</em></h3>
                    <p>Currently I work at Home Depot where the pace of work is much more relaxed and 
                        I'm not being worked to the bone. Home Depot was my first work place with managers who respect my choices and listen to what I have
                        to say, it has given me a proper respresentation of what a worker should be treated like (at the very least). I've found my own
                        voice to stand up for myself when something is wrong in the workplace due to them.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <h3></em>Video Games</em></h3>
                    <p>On my spare time there's nothing I love more than video games. A good video game pulls me in and I feel compelled to learn every aspect
                        I can and if it permits, improve against others. 
                    </p>
                    <h3></em>Camping</em></h3>
                    <p>My love for video games is unending, but this doesn't mean I don't also love the outdoors. Camping with your closest friends is something
                        I'd recommend to everyone. Being away from the responsiblilities and conveniences of society is an important experience to remind us what
                        we do everything for. It's the perfect way to take a break while simultaneously occupying yourself with something important but also simple.
                        (Ex: need food, need heat, need shelter.)
                    </p>
                    <h3></em>Cooking</em></h3>
                    <p>This hobby is something I feel very passionate about, especially with the way food prices are going, I think it's an important skill
                        for everyone to learn, why not be able to create restaurant quality meals for a third the price in the comfort of your own home?
